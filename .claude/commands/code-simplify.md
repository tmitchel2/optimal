# Simplify and improve code

## Prerequisites

You MUST read the following skills.

- developing-csharp-code
- implementing-github-issue
- simplifying-code
- using-github
- implementing-tests
- using-git-worktrees

## Code Simplify Command Workflow

1. Determine the code you have been asked to simplify and ensure it exists.  It could be a file or a folder, determine which one it is.  The simplifying-code skill instructs on how to deal with either.
2. Use a github issue and pr.
3. Use a git worktree, give it a name in the format "{PROJECT_NAME}-issue-{ISSUE_ID}", clean up the local git worktree once you are finished with it.
4. Immediately proceed to implementation of the issue using implementing-github-issue skill.

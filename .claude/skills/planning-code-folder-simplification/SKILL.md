# Planning Code Folder Simplification Skill

This skill provides information on how to orchestrate the process of simplifying the structure of descendant files and folders within a target folder.  The goal is to improve the existing folder structures so that it is more logically organised, understandable, maintainable and more easily debugged.  You must use language best practises to do this.

## Planning Code Folder Simplification Considerations

- Enter planning mode planning to simplify and improve a folder and its contents.
- Create a detailed plan for potentially reorganising / restructuring a folder that requires simplification.
- Explore the full set of folders and file names that exist beneath the target folder.
- Carry out reasearch on each file and produce a document listing the relative path of each file and very short concise description of the main defined entity within it.  Use this information to plan file movements to group closely related files together.
- Carry out research on the folder depth and naming against specified project / language conventions and best practises.  For example, the number of files within any single folder should be a reasonable amount, approximately 1-15.  If the number is higher than this then the folder should be analysed further to see how the files can be partitioned into a larger amount of folders each given a suitable name that groups the files logically and simply.
- Ensure that you follow solution and project structure best practises.
- The resultant modifications planned should be limited to file and folder moves and renames and internal changes related to references and namespacing.
- Functionality of the code should not be modified.
- The resultant folder structures **MUST** follow project / language conventions and best practises.

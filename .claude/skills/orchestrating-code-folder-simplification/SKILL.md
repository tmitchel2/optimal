# Simplifying Code Folder Skill

This skill provides information on how to orchestrate the process of simplifying the structure of the files within a folder and its descendants.  The goal is to improve the existing folder structures so that it is more logically organised, understandable, maintainable and more easily debugged.  You must use language best practises to do this.

## Code Folder Simplification Workflow

1. Enter planning mode to create detailed plan for potentially reorganising / restructuring a folder that requires simplification.
2. To formulate the plan, research should be carried out on folder depth and naming against specified project / language conventions and best practises.  For example, the number of files within any single folder should be a reasonable amount, approximately 1-15.  If the number is higher than this then the folder should be analysed further to see how the files can be partitioned into a larger amount of folders each given a suitable name that groups the files logically and simply.  Ensure that you follow solution and project structure best practises.  The resultant modifications planned should be limited to file and folder moves and renames and internal changes related to references and namespacing.  Functionality of the code should not be modified.  The resultant folder structures **MUST** follow project / language conventions and best practises.
3. Execute the plan.
